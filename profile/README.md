# HiBooSh: Highlights & Bookmarks Sharing

HiBooSh is an initiative to share & de-duplicate highlights & bookmarks in browsers. For now it
__doesn't__ provide any browser extensions itself.

## Browsers

Primarily Firefox, but any browsers supported by [Floccus](https://github.com/floccusaddon/floccus/)
if they support `data:` protocol/schema in bookmarked URLs.
